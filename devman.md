## Device Management


Massively distributed systems are challenging to update while maintaining consistency
among the included devices. They pose additional challenges compared to traditional architectures, such as
handling systems that are always on, large number of devices,
and moving from centralised to edge architectures.

It can not be assumed that all devices are available for updating at the same time, and in many cases
it is not feasible to shut down the system for updating.
This can make it difficult to deploy updates in a consistent and timely manner, which might be crucial when facing security vulnerabilities.
Additionally, the updating procedure itself must not open up for new vulnerabilities.

So, at the heart of this part of the
project is the requirement to securely distribute and install updated code in remote devices,
and to be able to do so in a timely manner that doesn't require the system to be shut down.
